1. NestJS (TypeScript) Rules:

Strict Typing: Never use any. Always define interfaces or classes.

Validation: Every Controller must use a DTO with class-validator decorators.

Architecture: Follow the Controller-Service-Repository pattern. Services handle logic; Repositories handle DB.

Error Handling: Use built-in HttpException classes.

2. Laravel (PHP) Rules:

Type Hinting: Use PHP 8.2+ strict typing for all function arguments and return types.

Validation: Always use FormRequest classes for validation. No $request->validate() in controllers.

Eloquent: Use Models for DB interaction, but keep heavy logic in Action classes or Services.

Testing: Default to Pest or PHPUnit for every new feature.

3. Agentic Behavior:

Test-First: Before completing a task, ask if you should generate a unit test.

Commit Style: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:).

Self-Correction: If a command fails in the terminal, analyze the stack trace and propose a fix immediately.
